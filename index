Ralphs_Voice is a speech-assist app designed to help children communicate using configurable flashcards, optional parent-recorded audio, and simple learning pages.  
We take privacy seriously — especially for children — and have built the app to work **without collecting personal data**.

## Quick Summary
- We don’t collect, share, or sell your personal data.  
- All flashcards, images, and **optional** voice recordings are stored **locally on the device**.  
- No ads. No analytics. No third-party SDKs.  
- The microphone is used only when you choose to record audio for a flashcard.  
- You can delete all content at any time in-app or by uninstalling the app.

## Information the App Uses

### Content You Add (Optional)
- **Voice recordings** you make for a flashcard (e.g., “apple.wav”).  
  → Stored locally in the app’s private storage.  
- **Custom images** you choose for a flashcard.  
  → Stored locally in the app’s private storage.  
- **Flashcard text and categories.**  
  → Stored locally as JSON in the app’s private storage.  

*None of the above is uploaded to us. Ralphs_Voice does not include an account system and does not transmit your data to a server.*

---

### Device Permissions
- **Microphone** – used only when you tap record to create your own audio for a flashcard.  
- **Storage/Photos** – used only if you pick an image from your device for a flashcard.  
- **Internet** – the app itself does not send data, but the OS may need basic access (e.g., for downloading text-to-speech voices or updates).  

---

### Automatically Collected Data
- **None.** We do not use analytics SDKs or crash reporters that transmit data to us.  

---

## Children’s Privacy
Ralphs_Voice is family-friendly and can be used by children with supervision.  
We **do not knowingly collect personal data from children**. All data remains on the device controlled by a parent/guardian.  

If you believe a child has sent us personal information (e.g., by email), contact us and we will delete it immediately.  

- In the **United States**, we aim to comply with **COPPA** by avoiding online collection from children under 13.  
- In the **UK/EU**, we aim to comply with **UK GDPR/GDPR** and the ICO **Children’s Code** by processing data only locally and providing parental control features.
