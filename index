    <h1>Ralphs_Voice — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 6 September 2025<br>

    <p>Ralphs_Voice is a speech‑assist app designed to help children communicate using configurable flashcards, optional parent‑recorded audio, and simple learning pages. We take privacy seriously—especially for children—and have built the app to work <strong>without collecting personal data</strong>.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Quick summary (plain English)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We don’t collect, share, or sell your personal data.</li>
      <li>All flashcards, images and <strong>optional</strong> voice recordings are stored on the device and stay there.</li>
      <li>The app has no ads and no analytics.</li>
      <li>The microphone is used only when you choose to record a sound for a flashcard.</li>
      <li>You can delete any content you add at any time from within the app or by uninstalling the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we ever add cloud features in the future, we’ll update this policy and ask for permission first.</p>

    <h2>What information the app uses</h2>
    <h3>Content you add (optional)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Voice recordings</strong> you make for a flashcard (e.g., “apple.wav”). Stored locally in the app’s private storage.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom images</strong> you choose for a flashcard. Stored locally in the app’s private storage.</li>
      <li><strong>Flashcard text</strong> and categories. Stored locally as JSON in the app’s private storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>None of the above is uploaded to us. Ralphs_Voice does not include an account system and does not transmit your data to a server.</em></p>

    <h3>Device permissions we request</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Microphone</strong> – only when you tap record to create your own audio for a flashcard.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage/Photos</strong> – if you pick an image from your device for a flashcard.</li>
      <li><strong>Internet</strong> – the app itself does not send data, but the OS may require basic network access for updates or text‑to‑speech voices managed by the device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Automatically collected data</h3>
    <p><strong>None.</strong> We do not use analytics SDKs or crash reporters that send data to us.</p>

    <h3>Children’s privacy</h3>
    <p>Ralphs_Voice is family‑friendly and can be used by children with supervision. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. All data remains on the device controlled by a parent/guardian. If you believe a child has sent us information (for example by email), contact us and we’ll delete it.</p>
    <p><em>If you are in the United States, we aim to comply with COPPA by avoiding online collection from children under 13. In the UK/EU, we aim to comply with UK GDPR/GDPR and the ICO Children’s Code by processing data locally and providing parental control features.</em></p>

    <h3>How we use information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To speak words/phrases and play your optional recordings.</li>
      <li>To save your chosen flashcards, categories, and images on the device so the app works as expected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where data is stored</h3>
    <p>Locally on your device in the app’s private storage. It is removed when you uninstall the app. We do not run any servers for the app at this time.</p>

    <h3>Data sharing and selling</h3>
    <p><strong>We do not share, transfer, or sell data</strong> to any third parties.</p>

    <h3>Data retention and deletion</h3>
    <p>Recordings, images, and flashcards remain only on your device until you delete them in the app or uninstall the app.</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>By default, app data is stored in the app’s private storage area. We encourage guardians to keep their device secured (screen lock, OS updates, etc.).</p>

    <h3>Changes to this policy</h3>
    <p>If we make material changes (for example, adding cloud backup), we will update this policy and, where appropriate, notify you in‑app and seek consent.</p>
