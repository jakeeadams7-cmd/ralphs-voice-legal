# Ralphs_Voice — Legal Documents

This repository hosts the **Privacy Policy** (and optionally Terms of Use) for the **Ralphs_Voice** app, developed by Jake Adams.

## 📄 Privacy Policy
The live hosted privacy policy is available at:

➡️ [Privacy Policy on GitHub Pages](https://jakeeadams7-cmd.github.io/ralphs-voice-legal/)

This policy explains:
- What data Ralphs_Voice uses (all stored **locally on the device**).
- How recordings, images, and flashcards are handled.
- That no data is collected, shared, or sold.
- Compliance with child privacy rules (COPPA, UK GDPR, GDPR).

## 📌 Purpose of this repo
App stores (Google Play / Amazon Appstore) require a **public Privacy Policy URL**.  
GitHub Pages provides a free, trusted way to host that document.

## 🛠 How it works
- The repo contains a static `index.html` file with the privacy policy.
- GitHub Pages serves that file at the live URL.
- No server-side code or data collection is involved.
